						Amsterdam, the Netherlands' capital, is one of the world's best hangout spots, 
						a place where you can immerse yourself in culture, history, art, in the head 
						of a beer or a self-rolled smoke. 						
						Amsterdam is situated 20 km from the sea, at the point where river Amstel joins 
						the river IJ. The city has a population of about 750,000 and is the country's 
						second largest port - after Rotterdam. Amsterdam is at the centre of a part of 
						the Netherlands where there are many places of interest within easy reach.

					<h2>Amsterdam museums</h2>
					<p>
						For a fairly small city, Amsterdam has a surprisingly large number of museums and 
						galleries. Traditional art-lovers know the route to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. 
						But modern art too is richly represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and 
						the Cobra museum in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of galleries, 
						especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And if you want to experience more 
						of nature, then the gardens of the universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses. 
						In a nutshell, there are lot of things to see in Amsterdam.  
					</p>
					<h2>Amsterdam Canals and Waterways</h2>
					<p>
						From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the very spirit of 
						Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, 
						a traditionally stylled lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside caf&eacute; and watch 
						an array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.
